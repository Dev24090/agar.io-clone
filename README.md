# agar.io-clone
I wouldn't call this a clone as an <i>exact copy</i>, rather a clone as the basic structure and *game-mechanics*.
This project is semi-complete (actually, I have a lot more to 'complete'). Like I said, I've have made an attempt to clone some of the game-mechanics. I will be updating this hopefully soon; now at the moment this game is currently <i>local</i>, and not <i>online</i>. Meaning it's not multiplayer. I will try to make this multiplayer in the future, but for now, I just need to add the split, and the feed (W) <i>functionallity</i>. Also, I will try to add viruses, and their mechanic. But for now, you just have to bare with a bunch of colorful dots, and a blob in the middle.
